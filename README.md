## EShop Modulith :shopping_cart:

This project is based on the Udemy course [“.NET Backend Bootcamp: Modulith vs. DDD, CQRS, and Outbox”](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-backend-bootcamp-modulith-vsa-ddd-cqrs-and-outbox/). 

While I am following the course as a reference, I am also making modifications along the way and using a different versioning approach.

The project has been upgraded to **.NET 9**, along with newer versions of some dependencies.

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Replace exceptions with the result pattern for better error handling
- [ ] Implement authorization policies for enhanced security:
  - Ensure that the basket/shopping cart can only be accessed by the associated user or an admin
  - Restrict product creation, modification, and deletion to admin users only

(More improvements to come!)
